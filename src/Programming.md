# Programming?

### Story Time

I have been programming since around 2016 when I started college and picked computer science as one of my A-levels. It's been an interesting journey as I haven't always enjoyed it. My first year of computer science at A-level I completely tanked my first year since I didn't pay attention in class, therefore I naturally got a U and almost dropped out of the subject, however one of the teachers saw some potential in my and decided to give me another chance under special exception since my first year teacher wasn't the best. After that I had to put in lots of extra work if I wanted to pass the next year. I had to take extra classes to catch up on all the content I didn't grasp the previous year. After a full year of extra classes and hard work I managed to raise my grade from an embarrassing U all the way to a C.  
Now this might not seem like an impressive grade but I learned so much and gained such a passion for programming from this year. It was a major point in my life that lead me towards computer science and software engineering
