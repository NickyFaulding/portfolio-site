# Programming?

#### I wanted to start with a small story about myself, feel free to skip and move straight to my programming proficiency :)

### Story Time

I have been in programming since about 2016 when I began university and chose computing as one of my A levels. It's been an interesting journey since I haven't always enjoyed it. My first year of computer science at A-level I completely tanked my first year since I didn't pay attention in class, therefore I naturally got a U and almost dropped from the subject. However, one of the teachers saw some potential in me and decided to give me another chance under a special exception since my first year teacher wasn't the best. After that, I had to put in a lot more work if I wanted to pass the next year. I had to take extra classes to catch up on all the content I hadn't grasped the previous year. After a full year of extra classes and hard work, I succeeded in getting my grade from an embarrassing U to a C.  
Now this may not seem like an impressive grade, but I learned so much and gained such a passion for programming this year. This was a major moment in my life which led me to computer science and software engineering.

### Programming Proficiency

First I will list the languages I'm using as of recently, Then I will go over some previous projects of mine.

Currently in my final year of university I have been using the following languages:

- C++
- C#
- JavaScript
  - Mongoose
  - Express
  - React
  - Node JS
  - Material UI

Other languages I have experience with: 

- C#
    - ASP .NET
    - Razor
- Java
- SQL (Oracle & Microsoft)

### Programming History

#### C++

I've been coding in C++ for 3 years now, starting in my first year of university. C++ always interested me but I always thought I wasn't smart enough to learn it, in my first year of uni we used C++ to create a version of Game of Life using Microsoft WinForms, I managed a janky version that worked however I wasn't happy with the result and proceeded to re-make the project in C# the following summer.

In second year of uni we used C++ to learn object oriented programming. The projects we made this year in C++ were a clone of Steam where users could manage their library of games and purchase new ones, it wasn't visually impressive however we were graded on functionality and code efficiency for this one. The next project was a game using RayLib. A library I really enjoyed using. While creating these projects we were taught the fundamentals of C++, including, Pointers, References, Polymorphism and some basic Standard Template Library usage.

And now halfway through my second semester in third year, I've experienced using so much more. I took the elective module: "Effective C++" since it stood out to me more than the others as a challenge. I wanted to learn the depths of one of the most powerful languages. The module has tested our ability to use the Standard Template Library to avoid writing unreadable lengthy code along with taking advantage it's useful containers. I have also explored creating my own templates while we were going over generic programming. For the rest of the module we will be going into detail regarding Multi-Threading in C++.

### C#

C# is a language I used to call my personal favourite, however since I've been so invested into C++ it's slowly become second, regardless it's a language I enjoy.

In the past I have used C# to create many projects. I have used C# WinForms to make games like Monopoly and Conway's Game of Life. I've used ASP .NET Razor pages with Entity Framework to make a CRUD website for one of my favourite games, Genshin Impact.
